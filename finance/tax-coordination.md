# Tax Coordination

This document describes how tax preparation and compliance are coordinated between Elm Lake Cranberry and the external CPA firm.

## Role of the CPA Firm

The CPA firm provides professional accounting and tax services, including:

- Preparation and filing of federal and state income tax returns
- Year-end financial statement review
- Tax planning and advisory services
- Accounting guidance on complex transactions
- Audit support if needed

The CPA firm does not handle day-to-day bookkeeping or transaction entry. Those are internal responsibilities.

## Division of Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Internal (ELC) | CPA Firm |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Daily transaction entry | Yes | No |
| Bank reconciliation | Yes | Reviews |
| Payroll processing | Yes (via OnPay) | No |
| Payroll tax filings | OnPay handles | Reviews |
| Monthly close | Yes | No |
| Year-end adjustments | Prepares drafts | Finalizes |
| Financial statements | Generates from QBO | Reviews and adjusts |
| Income tax returns | Provides data | Prepares and files |
| Tax payments | Executes payments | Calculates and advises |
| Tax planning | Participates | Leads |

## Data Provided to the CPA

At year-end and for tax preparation, ELC provides:

- QuickBooks Online access (Accountant user role)
- Year-end financial reports (P&L, Balance Sheet)
- Bank statements for the year
- Payroll reports and W-2 summaries from OnPay
- 1099 information for contractors
- Documentation for significant transactions
- Prior year tax returns (if CPA is new)
- Supporting schedules as requested

The CPA may request additional documentation during their review.

## CPA Access to Systems

| System | CPA Access Level |
|--------|------------------|
| QuickBooks Online | Accountant user (view and adjust) |
| OnPay | Reports only (no administrative access) |
| Bank accounts | Statement copies (no direct access) |

The CPA does not have administrative access to operational systems. Access is limited to what is needed for review and tax preparation.

## Tax Filing Calendar

Key tax dates (general guidance, confirm with CPA for specific deadlines):

| Filing | Typical Deadline | Responsible Party |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Quarterly payroll taxes | Quarterly (941, state) | OnPay files automatically |
| Annual payroll filings | January (W-2, W-3) | OnPay prepares; ELC distributes |
| 1099s to contractors | January 31 | ELC prepares; CPA reviews |
| Business income tax | March 15 or April 15 | CPA prepares and files |
| Estimated tax payments | Quarterly | CPA calculates; ELC pays |

Actual deadlines depend on entity type and fiscal year. The CPA provides a calendar of due dates.

## Year-End Process

1. **Internal close**: Bookkeeper completes year-end reconciliation and closes the books in QBO
2. **Data delivery**: Required reports and documentation are provided to CPA
3. **CPA review**: CPA reviews financials and proposes adjusting entries
4. **Adjustments**: Adjusting entries are entered into QBO (by CPA or bookkeeper)
5. **Tax preparation**: CPA prepares tax returns
6. **Review and approval**: Management reviews returns before filing
7. **Filing**: CPA files returns; ELC makes any required payments
8. **Document retention**: Final returns and supporting documents are stored

## Where Tax Documents Live

- **Draft returns and workpapers**: CPA firm retains working copies
- **Final signed returns**: Stored securely by ELC (not in this repository)
- **Supporting documentation**: Retained per document retention policy
- **Payment confirmations**: Stored with banking records

This repository does not store tax returns, financial statements, or sensitive tax data.

## Communication

- **Routine questions**: Email or phone with CPA staff
- **Year-end coordination**: Scheduled meetings or calls
- **Urgent tax matters**: Direct contact with CPA partner

Management maintains the primary relationship with the CPA firm. The bookkeeper coordinates data delivery and routine questions.

## AI Boundaries

AI does not prepare or file taxes. Tax preparation and compliance are handled by the CPA firm and authorized personnel.

AI may assist with:

- Organizing data for delivery to the CPA
- Reviewing QBO records for completeness before year-end
- Analyzing tax-related reports for internal understanding

AI does not:

- Prepare tax returns
- Calculate tax liability
- Communicate with the CPA on behalf of ELC
- Access CPA firm systems
- Make tax elections or decisions
