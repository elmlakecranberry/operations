# Checklists

Execution aids for daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks.

## What Belongs Here

Checklists are quick-reference documents for tasks that:

- Happen frequently
- Have multiple steps that are easy to forget
- Need to be done in a consistent order
- May be done by different people

Checklists are **not** full procedures. If something needs detailed explanation, it's an SOP.

## Checklist Characteristics

- Short and scannable
- Can be printed and used in the field
- Allowed to be blunt and practical
- Focus on action, not explanation
- Checkbox format encouraged

## Examples

- Daily pump station check
- Pre-frost preparation
- Equipment pre-start inspection
- End-of-day shop lockup
- Weekly truck inspection

## Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:

```
daily-pump-check.md
pre-harvest-equipment.md
weekly-truck-inspection.md
```

## Printing

Checklists may be printed for field use. Keep formatting simple—avoid complex tables or images that won't print well.
