# Standard Operating Procedures

This folder contains step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks at Elm Lake Cranberry.

## What Qualifies as an SOP

An SOP belongs here if:

- It describes a repeatable process
- It has discrete steps that can be followed
- Someone other than the author needs to be able to execute it
- Getting it wrong has consequences

An SOP does **not** belong here if:

- It's a one-time task
- It's a policy or guideline (those go in the management repo)
- It's a quick reference without steps (consider a checklist instead)

## SOP Requirements

Every SOP must include:

1. **Title** – Clear name for the procedure
2. **Owner** – Who is responsible for keeping this current
3. **Last Reviewed** – When this was last verified as accurate
4. **Purpose** – One sentence on why this exists
5. **Steps** – Numbered, actionable instructions
6. **Related Documents** – Links to checklists, runbooks, or external references

## Folder Structure

- `safety/` – Safety-related procedures (PPE, chemical handling, emergency protocols)
- `equipment/` – Equipment operation and care
- `irrigation/` – Water management procedures
- `frost-protection/` – Frost event preparation and response
- `harvest/` – Harvest operations and coordination
- `maintenance/` – Routine maintenance tasks

## Review Schedule

SOPs should be reviewed:

- Annually at minimum
- After any incident where the procedure failed or was unclear
- When equipment, tools, or systems referenced in the SOP change

## Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:

```
equipment-startup-procedure.md
chemical-application-safety.md
pump-station-daily-check.md
```

## Tools and Equipment

SOPs may (and should) reference specific tools, equipment, and products by name. This is the execution layer—be specific about what's actually used.
