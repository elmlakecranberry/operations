# Archive

Deprecated procedures and outdated documentation.

## What Belongs Here

Move documents here when:

- A procedure is no longer valid
- Equipment or systems referenced have been retired
- A process has been replaced by a new procedure
- Information is outdated but worth preserving for reference

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Current procedures (those stay in their active folders)
- Drafts or work-in-progress (don't commit those)
- Sensitive documents that should be deleted

## Important

**Nothing in this folder is considered current.**

Do not follow procedures found here without first verifying they still apply. If you need to revive an archived procedure, move it back to its appropriate folder and update it.

## Why We Keep This

Institutional memory matters. Archived procedures:

- Help understand why things changed
- Provide starting points for new procedures
- Answer "how did we used to do this?"
- Preserve context for future decisions

## Naming Convention

When archiving, prefix the filename with the archive date:

```
2024-01-15_old-pump-procedure.md
2023-09-01_retired-harvest-checklist.md
```

This makes it clear when the document was retired.
