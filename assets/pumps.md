# Pumps

Inventory of pumps at Elm Lake Cranberry.

## Guidance

Include any pump that:

- Moves water for irrigation, drainage, or frost protection
- Is critical to farm operations
- Requires maintenance or monitoring

Pumps are tracked separately because they are central to cranberry operations and have specific maintenance and energy requirements.
