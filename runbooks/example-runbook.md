# Power Outage Response

> **This is an example runbook for illustrative purposes. Replace with actual procedures and contacts.**

## Situation

Electrical power has been lost to one or more facilities.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Confirm the outage** – Check if it's localized (one building, one circuit) or widespread
2. **Check critical systems** – Identify what is affected (pumps, refrigeration, communications)
3. **Secure equipment** – Turn off equipment that shouldn't restart unexpectedly when power returns
4. **Notify key personnel** – Contact [designated contact] immediately

## Assessment

Determine:

- **Scope**: Single building? Entire property? Utility-wide?
- **Cause**: Known (storm, accident) or unknown?
- **Duration**: Has the utility provided an estimate?
- **Impact**: What operations are affected?

### If Power Is Out to Pump Stations During Irrigation Season:

- How long until crops are stressed?
- Is backup generation available?
- Can irrigation be shifted to unaffected areas?

### If Power Is Out to Critical Refrigeration:

- What is the temperature timeline before product is at risk?
- Can product be relocated?

## Response Options

### Option A: Wait for Utility Restoration

Appropriate when:
- Utility has provided a short ETA
- No critical operations are at risk
- Weather conditions are stable

Actions:
- Monitor utility status updates
- Prepare backup systems for deployment if needed

### Option B: Deploy Backup Generation

Appropriate when:
- Critical systems require power
- Restoration ETA is unknown or long
- Generator fuel and capacity are sufficient

Actions:
1. Locate and inspect generator
2. Confirm fuel level
3. Follow generator startup SOP
4. Connect critical loads only
5. Monitor generator during operation

### Option C: Implement Manual Workarounds

Appropriate when:
- Backup power is unavailable
- Specific tasks can be done manually
- Short-term solution is acceptable

## Escalation

Contact the following if:

- You cannot restore power or implement workarounds
- Duration exceeds [time threshold]
- Product or equipment is at risk

| Role | Contact |
|------|---------|
| Operations Manager | [Phone] |
| Utility Emergency | [Phone] |
| Generator Service | [Phone] |

## Recovery

When power is restored:

1. Do not restart all equipment simultaneously
2. Inspect equipment for damage before restarting
3. Restart critical systems first
4. Monitor for issues during the first hour
5. Document the outage in the incident log
