# Runbooks

Situation-based guides for responding to specific scenarios, often under time pressure.

## What Belongs Here

Runbooks are for situations where:

- Something unexpected has happened or is about to happen
- Time matters
- Clear, direct instructions are needed
- The reader may be stressed or unfamiliar with the situation

Runbooks are **not** routine procedures. If it happens on a regular schedule, it's probably an SOP.

## Runbook Characteristics

- Situation-based (starts with "what's happening")
- Direct and procedural
- Prioritizes action over explanation
- Includes escalation paths and contacts
- Assumes the reader needs to act now

## Examples

- Frost event response
- Power outage
- Pump failure during irrigation
- Equipment breakdown during harvest
- Water emergency (flood, contamination)
- IT system outage

## Format

Runbooks should include:

1. **Situation** – What triggered this runbook
2. **Immediate Actions** – What to do right now
3. **Assessment** – How to evaluate the situation
4. **Response Options** – Possible courses of action
5. **Escalation** – Who to contact if you can't resolve it
6. **Recovery** – How to return to normal operations

## Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:

```
frost-event-response.md
pump-failure.md
power-outage.md
```

## Keep It Current

Runbooks are useless if they're wrong. Review and test runbooks:

- Before each season where they're relevant
- After any incident where the runbook was used
- When equipment, contacts, or procedures change
