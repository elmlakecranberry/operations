# Fuel & Power Coordination

This document catalogs the fuel and power sources available at Elm Lake Cranberry, documenting storage capacity, delivery dependencies, and seasonal risks.

## Why This Matters

### Storage ownership

Who controls the storage tank determines who controls the supply. Leased tanks may be subject to supplier terms, delivery schedules, or removal. Owned tanks can be filled by any supplier and maintained on your schedule.

### Delivery dependency as hidden risk

A full tank means nothing if the delivery truck can't reach you. Delivery dependencies include:

- Road conditions (mud, snow, flooding)
- Supplier availability during peak demand
- Lead time required for orders
- Minimum delivery quantities

A propane tank with 10 days of fuel and a 14-day delivery lead time has negative runway.

### Seasonal stress

Winter is the default assumption for this audit. Cold weather increases fuel consumption, restricts delivery access, and raises the stakes of any failure. Summer-only assets should be noted, but winter readiness is the baseline.

## How to Use This Table

This table helps answer two questions:

1. **How long can we operate if deliveries stop?**
   Look at Typical Runway for each fuel source. The shortest runway is your constraint.

2. **What could prevent a delivery from arriving?**
   Look at Delivery Dependency. Consider road conditions, supplier reliability, and lead times.

**Coordination with the Asset Audit:**

Cross-reference this table with the energy-power-dependency-audit.md. For each fuel source listed here, identify which assets depend on it. If a fuel source has a 7-day runway and an asset has a 0-day failure tolerance, the actual runway is 0 days.

**Review process:**

1. Update Typical Runway based on current storage levels
2. Verify delivery dependencies before winter
3. Confirm supplier contacts are current
4. Note any changes in access (road work, seasonal closures)
