**Applies To:** Payroll administrators, management  
**Scope:** All Workers’ Compensation (WC) wage replacement situations  
**Status:** Active  
**Effective:** December 2025

---

## Purpose

This SOP defines the required payroll steps for administering Paid Time Off (PTO) top-off when an employee is receiving Workers’ Compensation wage benefits. Its purpose is to ensure consistent, compliant, and auditable handling of WC-related absences.

---

## Governing Policy

This SOP implements the **Workers’ Compensation and PTO Top-Off Policy** maintained in the employee handbook. In the event of any conflict, the handbook policy controls.

---

## Key Principles

- Workers’ Compensation replaces a **portion** of wages under state law.
- PTO/Vacation may be used only to **top off** the gap between WC benefits and normal wages.
- PTO/Vacation is **not** paid as full additional days on top of WC benefits.
- Payroll does **not** reconcile to actual WC payments.
- Estimates are based on statutory replacement rates.

## Step-by-Step Payroll Procedure

### 1. Identify WC Hours
For each pay period:
- Collect WC hours missed due to medical appointments or approved WC leave.
- Separate WC hours from worked hours and PTO-only hours.

---

### 2. Apply Statutory Replacement Estimate
- Assume WC wage replacement at the statutory rate (typically 66⅔% of Average Weekly Wage, subject to state maximums).
- Do not wait for confirmation of actual WC payment amounts.

---

### 3. Calculate PTO Top-Off

For WC-covered hours:

```
PTO top-off hours = WC hours × (1 − statutory replacement rate)
```

Example:
- WC replacement rate: 66⅔%  
- PTO top-off rate: 33⅓%  
- 8-hour WC day → 2.67 hours PTO deducted

---

### 4. Enter Payroll

- Pay regular wages for worked hours.  
- Enter PTO top-off hours as paid PTO.  
- Do not enter full 8-hour PTO days for WC-covered days.

---

### 5. Handle Timing Errors

If payroll runs before PTO top-off is applied:
- Issue a supplemental payroll run.  
- Do not claw back or offset WC payments.  
- Document the correction internally.

---

## Carrier Coordination

- WC claims are administered by the insurance carrier.  
- The employee is responsible for communicating with the adjuster and providing work slips.  
- Payroll may confirm wage basis and statutory rate with the carrier but does not depend on payment timing.

---

## Documentation Requirements

For each WC case:
- Maintain internal HR case notes.  
- Retain carrier correspondence.  
- Record payroll adjustments and supplemental runs.

---

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not pay full PTO days in addition to WC benefits for the same hours.  
- Do not retroactively change PTO application based on WC check amounts.  
- Do not make exceptions based on employee preference.
