# Systems

Documentation for tools, software, and services used at Elm Lake Cranberry.

## What Belongs Here

This folder documents:

- What software and tools we use
- How to access and use them
- Account setup and permissions
- Vendor contacts and support information
- Integration between systems
- Common tasks and troubleshooting

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Policies about data retention, privacy, or compliance (those are management decisions)
- Financial details, pricing, or contract terms
- Passwords, API keys, or credentials (never commit these)
- Decisions about which systems to use (that's management)

This folder documents **how to use** systems, not **whether to use** them.

## Folder Structure

- `accounting/` – Financial software and bookkeeping tools
- `payroll-hr/` – Payroll processing and HR systems
- `file-storage/` – Document management and file sharing
- `communications/` – Email, messaging, and collaboration tools
- `gis-mapping/` – Geographic information systems and mapping tools

## Naming Specific Vendors

This folder may (and should) name specific vendors, software, and services. Be direct about what we use. This is operational documentation, not a competitive analysis.

## Keeping It Current

Systems change. When software is updated, replaced, or retired:

1. Update the relevant documentation
2. Note the change date
3. If a system is fully retired, move docs to `/archive/`
