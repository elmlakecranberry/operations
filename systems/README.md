# Systems

This folder documents the tools and systems used day to day at Elm Lake Cranberry.

## Purpose

An employee or manager should be able to answer:

- "Which system do I use for this?"
- "What is the source of truth for X?"
- "Where does this information live?"

This is practical, tool-specific documentation. It tells you what we use and how to use it.

## What Lives Here vs. What Lives in Management

| This folder (operations) | Management repo |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Tool names and how to use them | Decisions about which tools to adopt |
| What each system is authoritative for | Policies governing those systems |
| Operational procedures | Approval thresholds and authority |
| Day-to-day workflows | Strategic direction |

These systems **implement** decisions made elsewhere. They do not **define** authority.

## System Categories

| Category | Primary Tool | What It Handles |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Accounting | QuickBooks Online | Transactions, financial records, statements |
| Payroll & HR | OnPay | Payroll processing, employment records |
| File Storage | Google Drive | Documents, attachments, collaboration |
| Version Control | GitHub | SOPs, operations handbook, system docs |
| Communications | [See folder] | Email, messaging, coordination |
| GIS & Mapping | [See folder] | Spatial data, property maps |

## Quick Reference: Where Things Live

## GitHub

GitHub hosts this operations repository and serves as the version-controlled home for procedures, SOPs, and system documentation.

### What GitHub Is Used For

- This operations handbook
- Standard operating procedures
- System documentation
- Checklists and runbooks
- Templates

### What GitHub Is NOT Used For

- Casual document drafting (use Google Drive)
- Management authority or policies
- Financial records
- Sensitive personnel information

### How to Use It

- **Most employees**: Read-only access via web browser
- **Linking**: Share links to specific procedures rather than copying content
- **Editing**: Only designated SOP owners make changes
- **No Git knowledge required**: The web interface is sufficient for reading

If you need a procedure updated, contact the owner listed on that document.

## Keeping Documentation Current

Systems change. When software is updated, replaced, or retired:

1. Update the relevant documentation in this folder
2. Note the change date
3. If a system is fully retired, move its docs to `/archive/`

Tool documentation lives here, not scattered across emails or shared drives.
