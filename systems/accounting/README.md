# Accounting: QuickBooks Online

QuickBooks Online is the accounting system of record for Elm Lake Cranberry.

## What QuickBooks Is Authoritative For

QuickBooks is the source of truth for:

- **Transactions** – All income, expenses, and transfers
- **Financial statements** – Profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow
- **Historical financial records** – Past transactions and account history
- **Vendor and customer records** – Contact info, payment terms, transaction history
- **Invoice and payment tracking** – What's been billed, what's been paid

If you need to know what a transaction was, when it happened, or what the financial record shows, QuickBooks is where you look.

## What QuickBooks Is NOT Authoritative For

QuickBooks does not define:

- **Budgets** – Budget summaries and targets live in the management repo
- **Spending policies** – Approval thresholds and purchasing rules are management decisions
- **Financial strategy** – Investment decisions, capital planning, and financial goals
- **Audit or compliance requirements** – Those are governed by policy, not this tool

QuickBooks records what happened. Management decides what should happen.

## Who Uses QuickBooks

| Role | Access Level | Typical Tasks |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Bookkeeper | Full access | Transaction entry, reconciliation, reporting |
| Owner/Manager | Reporting access | Review statements, approve transactions |
| Accountant (external) | Accountant access | Year-end review, tax preparation |

Most employees do not need direct access. If you need financial information, request a report from the bookkeeper.

## Common Tasks

### Generating Reports

Standard reports are run from QuickBooks and shared as PDFs or exported to spreadsheets. Common reports include:

- Profit & Loss (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Balance Sheet
- Accounts Payable Aging
- Accounts Receivable Aging

### Where Reports Go

- Routine reports are saved to Google Drive in the appropriate folder
- Reports for management review are shared as needed
- Year-end reports go to the external accountant

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Payroll (OnPay)**: Payroll transactions sync to QuickBooks automatically
- **Banking**: Bank feeds import transactions for reconciliation

## Getting Help

- **Software issues**: Contact QuickBooks support or the designated system administrator
- **Process questions**: Contact the bookkeeper
- **Policy questions**: Refer to the management repo or ask a manager
